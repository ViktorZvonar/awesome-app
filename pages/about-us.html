      <p>I am a web developer with over 5 years of
        experience. I specializes in frontend development and has a
        knack for creating user-friendly designs. My passions
        include problem-solving, learning new technologies, and
        playing video games in my spare time.

      <p>I am a bright front-end developer with a solid knowledge of backend technologies. I take pride in creating
        user-friendly interfaces and seamless user experiences, and I believe that the key to a successful project is in
        the details.
        Aside from coding, I have an adventurous spirit that loves challenges. I believe this spirit helps me in my
        coding career as it pushes me to go beyond my comfort zone, explore new technologies, and constantly update my
        knowledge base.
        I also love biscuits! From classic shortbread to inventive, gourmet flavours, I'm always ready to try out new
        varieties. I find the process of baking, especially the precision and creativity involved, quite similar to
        coding. Both require an accurate recipe (or algorithm) and the freedom to tweak and make it your own.
        When I'm not immersing myself in code or enjoying biscuits, you'll probably find me on roller skates. I find
        roller skating to be a perfect blend of fitness, precision, and fun. It allows me to switch off from the digital
        world, soak up the surroundings, and maintain my physical fitness - all while doing something I truly enjoy.

        I'm Elif, a dedicated back-end developer with a passion for cloud technologies and cyber security. With
        extensive experience in Node.js, Django, and Ruby on Rails, I specialize in building robust and secure back-end
        infrastructures. I understand that a strong back-end is just as important as an impressive front-end for
        creating performant applications. Beyond my technical skills, I bring a strong problem-solving mindset and a
        constant drive to stay updated with the latest technologies. My passion for cyber security reinforces my
        commitment to creating applications that are not only functional, but also secure and reliable.
